# Business-and-Operations-Metrics-Analysis
Trainity Project - 3
This project involved firstly migrating excel dataset into MySQL which was pretty time consuming as there were almost 3L+ rows. 
So working with such large datasets helps you develop effecient ways of querying data from the tables. 
After importing all the Excel sheets into MySQL database, I have performed many complex SQL queries to answer the questions posted by management.
